# A-k-algorithm
We invent a new distributed algorithms with some estimators when not given mean capacity of all network links, using the augmentation algorithm from [Sanghavi's paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0611064), [UCB](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1013689704352), and [Thompson sampling](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2332286).
